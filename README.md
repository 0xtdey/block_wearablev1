**Problem** : Currently all smart wearable store user data on their app which is centralized. Almost all the times this data is being monitored and sold off to companies for research/ marketing purposes. Which is unethical as that data is sensitive to a particular user and reveals a lot of intricate details about them.

**Solution** : A system where the data from the wearable is logged into the blockchain directly. So, the user data remains safe and anonymous. Secondly, the users can choose if they want to opt in to share their health data for research purposes and they will get incentivized for it. 
>[!NOTE]
>The wearable may not necessarily be made by us, it will be an aim for the future. Currently we will build the architecture in which the companies can opt in to use our system as back-end. We need to build it in such a way that existing companies can plug it into their systems without much hassle.

### 6-Month Roadmap for Developing the Backend Product

#### Month 1: **Planning and Requirement Gathering**

1. **Research and Analysis**
    
    - Study existing wearable APIs and data formats.
    - Analyze blockchain protocols best suited for storing and handling sensitive data (e.g., Polygon, Arbitrum).
    - Review regulations like GDPR and HIPAA for compliance.
2. **Define Scope and Features**
    
    - Finalize core functionalities:
        - Data logging from wearables to blockchain.
        - User opt-in and consent management.
        - Incentivization mechanism.
3. **Architecture Design**
    
    - Define the architecture for integration with existing systems.
    - Choose tools for development (e.g., Solidity, Foundry, Node.js for APIs).
4. **Team Setup**
    
    - Assign roles (e.g., blockchain developer, backend developer, security expert).

#### Month 2: **Prototype Development**

1. **Build Core Blockchain Contracts**
    
    - Create smart contracts for:
        - Data storage and encryption.
        - User consent management.
        - Incentive distribution.
2. **Develop API Layer**
    
    - Design APIs to enable companies to send data to the blockchain via the system.
3. **Initial Testing**
    
    - Test core functionalities in a development environment.

---

#### Month 3: **Integration and Refinement**

1. **Develop Plug-and-Play SDK**
    
    - Create SDKs/libraries for companies to integrate easily (e.g., in Python, JavaScript).
2. **Data Privacy and Encryption**
    
    - Implement robust encryption for user data before blockchain storage.
3. **Build Consent Dashboard**
    
    - Develop a UI mockup to allow users to manage their consent.

---

#### Month 4: **Testing and Optimization**

1. **Test Across Scenarios**
    
    - Simulate various data logging scenarios using sample wearable data.
    - Ensure low-latency interactions with the blockchain.
2. **Security Testing**
    
    - Perform audits on smart contracts.
    - Implement safeguards against data breaches.
3. **Optimize Costs**
    
    - Reduce gas fees through efficient contract design.
    - Explore layer-2 scaling solutions if necessary.

---

#### Month 5: **Partnership and Onboarding**

1. **Develop Onboarding Documentation**
    
    - Create detailed documentation for companies to integrate the system.
    - Include setup guides, API references, and SDK examples.
2. **Pilot Testing with Partner Companies**
    
    - Collaborate with 1â€“2 wearable companies to test the system.
3. **Incorporate Feedback**
    
    - Refine architecture and contracts based on feedback.

---

#### Month 6: **Launch and Support**

1. **Final Deployment**
    
    - Deploy contracts to the mainnet.
    - Launch the SDK and API officially.
2. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
    
    - Set up analytics to monitor system performance.
    - Establish a feedback loop for continuous improvements.
3. **Marketing and Outreach**
    
    - Pitch to more companies with a ready-to-use backend.
    - Highlight benefits: data privacy, compliance, and user incentives.

---

### Suggestions and Improvements

1. **Interoperability Focus**
    
    - Ensure the architecture supports multiple blockchain protocols. This flexibility could attract a broader range of companies.
2. **Data Aggregation Tools**
    
    - Consider building tools that help researchers aggregate and analyze anonymized data directly.
3. **Compliance Features**
    
    - Add built-in compliance checks for GDPR, HIPAA, or other regional data privacy laws.
4. **Decentralized Identity (DID)**
    
    - Integrate DID solutions like ENS or Ceramic to ensure secure and verifiable user identities without compromising privacy.
5. **Future Proofing**
    
    - Modularize the system to incorporate new wearables or blockchain advancements easily.
